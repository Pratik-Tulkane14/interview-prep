## Introduction
This guide covers Redux Toolkit (RTK), the official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development in React applications. It includes implementation examples, best practices, and common interview questions.

## What is Redux Toolkit?
Redux Toolkit is the official package that simplifies Redux development by providing utilities to reduce boilerplate code. It includes essential Redux packages and commonly used dependencies while enforcing Redux best practices out of the box.

## Why Redux Toolkit?
- Reduces boilerplate code compared to vanilla Redux
- Simplifies common Redux use cases
- Prevents common mistakes
- Includes popular middleware like Redux Thunk by default
- Makes immutable updates easier with Immer.js integration
- Provides better TypeScript support

## Key Features

### CreateSlice
Combines reducers and actions in one place:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1  // Immer makes this immutable behind the scenes
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    }
  }
})
```

### ConfigureStore
Simplified store setup:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterSlice.reducer
  }
})
```

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Setting up Provider

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import store from './store'

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <YourComponents />
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

### 2. Using in Components

```javascript
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import { increment, decrement } from './counterSlice'

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value)
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+</button>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use createSlice**
   - Replace separate actions and reducers with createSlice
   - Take advantage of simplified syntax

2. **Leverage RTK Query**
   - Use for data fetching when applicable
   - Benefits from automatic caching and request deduplication

3. **State Normalization**
   - Use createEntityAdapter for collections
   - Maintain normalized state structure

4. **Development Tools**
   - Always use Redux DevTools for debugging
   - Monitor state changes and action dispatches

5. **File Structure**
   - Follow Redux Toolkit conventions
   - Organize by feature/domain
   - Keep related logic together

## Interview Questions

### Q: How is Redux Toolkit different from vanilla Redux?
Redux Toolkit reduces boilerplate, includes useful dependencies, and provides utilities like createSlice that combine actions and reducers. It also includes Immer for simpler immutable updates.

### Q: When should you use Redux Toolkit vs. Context API?

#### Use Redux Toolkit for:
- Complex state logic
- Frequent updates
- Large applications
- Need for dev tools and middleware
- Team collaboration with established patterns

#### Use Context API for:
- Simple state management
- Infrequent updates
- Small to medium applications
- Theme/authentication state

### Q: How does RTK handle immutability?
RTK uses Immer.js internally, allowing you to write "mutating" logic in reducers while Immer handles the immutable updates behind the scenes.
